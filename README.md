# Peronsal Finances Project

A dockerised Airflow repository to automate API calls to your bank account (only Monzo currently supported) to store transactions in a Postgres database, check data quality with Great Expectations and visualise your data on Metabase. DAGs to pull transactions and store to a database, move money between Monzo Pots for automated budgetting and to create custom push notifications to your Monzo app.
